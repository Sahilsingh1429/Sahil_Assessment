    "# Prepare demonstration of Python E-Note Book under software development principles and follow coding protocols\n",
    "\n",
    "1.) Write a clear problem statement: Before starting any software development,it is essential to write a clear problem statement.\n",
    "    In the case of our Python E-Notebook, the problem statement could be\n",
    "    \"To develop a console-based Python E-Notebook application that allows users to\n",
    "    create and share documents containing live code, equations, visualizations, and narrative text.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "2.) Define the scope and requirements: Once we have a clear problem statement,we need to define the scope and requirements of the application.\n",
    "    This includes deciding what features the application should have,what platforms it should run on,and any performance requirements.\n",
    "    We can also define any constraints,such as time or budget limitations.\n",
    "    \n",
    "3.) Design the architecture: Once we have defined the scope and requirements, we can design the architecture of the application.\n",
    "    This involves deciding on the overall structure of the application,including the user interface,\n",
    "    data storage, and any third-party libraries or services that will be used.\n",
    "\n",
    "4.) Write the code: With the architecture designed, we can start writing the code.\n",
    "    We should follow coding protocols and best practices such as writing clean, readable code, commenting our code, and using version control.\n",
    "    \n",
    "5.) Test the application: Once we have written the code, we need to test the application to ensure it meets the requirements and \n",
    "    functions correctly.We should also test the application in various environments to ensure it runs correctly on different platforms.\n",
    "    \n",
    "Some coding protocols we can follow when developing the Python E-Notebook include:\n",
    "    \n",
    "Following the PEP 8 style guide for Python code.\n",
    "Using meaningful variable and function names.\n",
    "Writing docstrings for all functions and modules.\n",
    "Using comments to explain complex code or logic.\n",
    "Avoiding hardcoded values and using constants instead.\n",
    "Using try-except blocks to handle exceptions.\n",
    "Using version control, such as Git, to track changes and collaborate with others."
